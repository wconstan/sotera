Data Scientist Interview Homework

Problem Prompt

A large part of a role as a data scientist is obtaining and cleaning

data. As a part of this interview, we will test your ability to do

so with a fairly straight forward task. What you we will be ask-
  ing you to do is to obtain an large volume of geo-tagged tweets

from a single user in the greater Seattle area, and calculate the

probability that this user is in a specific location, given this data. If

you don’t have a twitter developer account, registration is free at

https://dev.twitter.com/.

Identify a High Volume Individual Tweeter

To Identify a high volume individual tweeter, it is recommended

that you scrape the 1% stream with a bounding box around the area.

Typically users will geotag all or none of their tweets, so you will

probably have sufficient candidates after scraping for only a few

minutes.

Find their Locations

Once you have a few candidates, you can use the api to search their

catalog for historical tweet info. As mentioned previously, you’ll

want to find a user who has a few hundred geotagged tweets, so you

may need to go through a few candidates. Once you have found a

candidate, divide the area into a the nearest hundredth of a degree

(in lat-lon) and from their calculate a percentage.

What to Return

Please return the script you used to identify users, obtain the data,

and perform the calculations (they can be multiple scripts). The re-
  sults should be in a text file with 3 columns: lat, lon, percentage that

user is there, as well as a brief description of what you did.
